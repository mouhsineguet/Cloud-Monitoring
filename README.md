# Cloud-Monitoring
## OverView
"This is from GSP089 lab at Quicklabs platform".
Cloud Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. 
Cloud Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, hosted uptime probes, 
application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others. 
Cloud Monitoring ingests that data and generates insights via dashboards, charts, and alerts. Cloud Monitoring alerting helps you collaborate by integrating with Slack, PagerDuty, HipChat, Campfire, and more.

## Problem Scenario:
How to monitor a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance with Cloud Monitoring. 
We'll also install monitoring and logging agents for our VM which collects more information from our instance, which could include metrics and logs from 3rd party apps.

## Ops agents
The Ops Agent collects logs and metrics on Compute Engine instances, sending the logs to Cloud Logging and the metrics to Cloud Monitoring.

## dashboard and chart
You can display the metrics collected by Cloud Monitoring in your own charts and dashboards. In this section you create the charts for the lab metrics and a custom dashboard.
